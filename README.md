# Recommender
Build intelligence to help customers discover products they may like and most likely purchase<br>

<br>1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:<br>

Download the provided dataset (Recommnder.zip).<br>
This dataset likely includes information about products, customers, purchases, and browsing behavior.<br>
Use libraries like Pandas to explore and clean the data. Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and format data appropriately.<br>
Consider creating additional features like product categories, user demographics, or purchase frequency.<br>
<br>2. Recommendation Techniques:<br>

Collaborative Filtering (CF): This technique recommends products similar to what other users with similar purchase history have liked.<br>
Implement algorithms like Matrix Factorization using libraries like scikit-learn Surprise.<br>
Content-Based Filtering (CBF): This recommends products with similar features to what the user has previously purchased or browsed.<br>
Analyze product features like brand, category, price, etc. Use techniques like TF-IDF for item similarity.<br>
<br>3. Hybrid Models:<br>

Combine CF and CBF to leverage user-item interactions and product features for more robust recommendations.<br>
Weighted approaches can prioritize user preferences or product attributes based on the scenario.<br>
<br>4. Evaluation Metrics:<br>

Implement metrics like:<br>
Precision: Ratio of correctly recommended items to all recommendations.<br>
Recall: Ratio of correctly recommended items to all relevant items the user might like.<br>
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.<br>
Mean Average Precision (MAP): Average of precision at all retrieval positions.<br>
Use libraries like scikit-learn metrics to calculate these scores.<br>
Evaluate the performance of each model (CF, CBF, and Hybrid) and choose the one with the highest accuracy and relevance.<br>
<br>5. Deliverables:<br>

<br>Report: Create a PDF report detailing:<br>
System design and architecture (data flow, models used).<br>
Description of recommendation techniques and their benefits.<br>
Evaluation metrics used and achieved performance.<br>
Benefits for the e-commerce organization (increased sales, customer satisfaction).<br>
